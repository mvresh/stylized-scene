// blended transparency) so the cutout stays crisp and casts/receives clean
// shadows without depth-sort artifacts between the overlapping cards. The same
// wind displacement that drives the grass is applied here so the canopy sways
// in sync with the field, anchored at the bottom where the trunk will attach.
